# LoanDefaultPrediction-RIskAnalysis
This project provides a Python script for managing gas injection and withdrawal contracts. The goal of the script is to optimize the management of gas storage, including handling purchases, injections, withdrawals, and associated costs. The program calculates total storage costs, transaction costs, and overall revenue based on user-provided input and output dates, prices, and rates.

**Features:**

**Gas Injection Management:** Handles the purchase and storage of gas based on input dates and prices.

**Gas Withdrawal Management:** Manages the withdrawal and sale of stored gas based on output dates and prices.

**Cost Calculations:** Computes transaction costs, purchase costs, withdrawal revenue, and storage costs.

**Capacity Checks:** Ensures gas injection and withdrawal are feasible based on available storage and gas volume.

**Requirements**

Python 3.x

No external libraries required (standard Python modules: datetime, math)
